# Rock Paper Scissors (The Odin Project)

_This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with vanilla JavaScript as part of The Odin Project curriculum._

## The game runs in the browser using prompt() and console.log() for interaction. The player competes against the computer, and the first to reach 5 points wins the game.

### How it works

- The computer randomly selects between rock, paper, or scissors.
- The player inputs their choice via a prompt.
- Each round determines a winner or a draw.
- Scores are tracked until one side reaches 5 points.
